## Practicals: exploring planktonic communities in the *Tara Oceans*
Instructor: Pedro C. Junger (pjunger@bio.ens.psl.eu)

## This repo includes:
This repo contains the R Markdown script and the outputs for the practical session of the Marine Ecology & Biodiversity course as part of the PSL-Week. The aim of this tutorial is providing the students a toolbox to explore the *Tara Oceans* datasets to study plankton diversity in the global ocean. The example dataset is the *Tara Oceans* 18SV4 data processed by the swarm pipeline, but the current script should be easily adaptable to other datasets.

### Datasets:
The example OTU and taxonomy tables are available here: <https://zenodo.org/records/7235995>, while the contextual data is here: <https://zenodo.org/records/7229815>.

  * **TARA-Oceans_18S-V4_Swarm-Mumu_table.tsv**: this dcodes used to create the figures and run the analysis conducted throughout the main text of the manuscript
  * **TARA-Oceans_18S-V4_Swarm-Mumu_taxo.tsv**: codes used to create the figures and run the analysis used in the supplementary material of the manuscript
  * **context_general.tsv**: codes used to create the figures and run the analysis used in the supplementary material of the manuscript
  * **context_stat.tsv**: codes used to create the figures and run the analysis used in the supplementary material of the manuscript

### Raw datasets:
  * **spatial_dataset.csv**: raw spatial dataset used in this manuscript
  * **seasonal_dataset.csv**: raw seasonal dataset used in this manucript
  * **mean_data.csv**: mean values of the seasonal dataset used in the supplementary material of this manuscript
  * **surf_bottom_sup_mat.csv**: surface and bottom seasonal pCO2 values from Gargalheiras and Cruzeta reservoirs used in the supplementary material of this manuscript
